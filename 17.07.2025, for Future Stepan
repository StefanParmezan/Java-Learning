# Java Learning Journey

I've completed the Java Core section in just 5 months â€” it was a challenging, deep, and incredibly interesting experience.
This repository contains my practice projects, exercises, and solutions from the Java Core learning path, including topics like:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Collections framework
- Stream API
- Functional programming
- Exception handling
- Working with Optional
- Multithreading and parallel streams
- Working with data structures and algorithms

All the code here shows my understanding of Java fundamentals and my approach to problem-solving using modern Java practices.

Now I'm ready to move on to the next big step â€” **Spring Boot** ðŸš€
I'm excited to start building real-world applications and dive into backend development with Spring.

Feel free to check out my code, run the examples, and see how I've grown as a developer in just a few months of focused learning.

I'm not just learning Java â€” I'm building a foundation for a future career in software development.
